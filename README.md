# Morphological-operations
Applied morphological operations to enhance and analyze images for feature extraction and preprocessing usong Python in VS Code.
# Image Processing with Dilation & Erosion

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **morphological operations**—dilation and erosion—for image preprocessing and feature enhancement.

## Features
- **Dilation:** Expands bright regions of an image to fill gaps and enhance features.
- **Erosion:** Shrinks bright regions to remove noise or small irrelevant details.
- Preprocessing step for further computer vision tasks such as edge detection or object recognition.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV / NumPy

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Image-Processing-Dilation-Erosion.git
